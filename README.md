Just a few attempts at solving "nqueens with a twist" using the z3 SMT solver.

Don't expect greatness here... this is just a bit of ugly hackery in an attempt
to learn a thing or two about SMT solvers.

queens_solver.py and queens_solver1.py are modified from 0vercl0k's lovely
example found here: https://github.com/0vercl0k/z3-playground/blob/master/nqueens_z3.py

propositional_nqueens.py is my attempt at rewriting this using semi brute-forced
propositional logic.
